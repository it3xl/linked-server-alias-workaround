# linked-server-alias-workaround
SQL Server Linked Server's aliasing workaround.

SCAFFOLDING, the main idea.

What of you want to pass a name of a linked server as a parameter to a stored procedure?
Or store it in a variable and modify and invoke dynamically?

What if you code base is tremendous and you can't use childish approaches from over the Internet?
Do you interact with hundreds of tables and views?

Are you tackle with any of this? Come here, I'll show something.

You are receiving a working & tested solution and free to evolve it farther.

Microsoft SQL server doesn't allow you to have a reference to a linked server or an alias.
This is infamous feature and view of Microsoft, for decades.

This technic will allow you to preserve straightforward, standard and well-known developing.
Of course, you will look on things from another side, thanks for Microsoft.
But your dev & support will be happy.

To start using it, you need
1.
